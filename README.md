Of course. A great README file is essential for any project. It acts as the front door, explaining what your project does, why it's useful, and how to use it.

Here is a complete, professional `README.md` file tailored for your Vocalytics application. It includes sections on features, architecture, setup, and usage, with a prominent placeholder for your deployment link.

Just copy the entire content below into a new file named `README.md` in the root of your project directory.

# 🎙️ Vocalytics: AI-Powered Voice Analysis


Vocalytics is an intelligent web application that analyzes voice recordings to predict gender and age group. It is built with a continuous learning pipeline, allowing the model to improve over time with user-submitted feedback.

## 🚀 Live Demo


**[➡️ Access the Live App Here](YOUR_STREAMLIT_APP_LINK_HERE)**


## ✨ Features

-   **Multi-Source Input**: Analyze voice from:
    -   🎤 **Live Recording**: Record audio directly in the browser.
    -   🎵 **Audio Upload**: Upload common audio formats (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`).
    -   📹 **Video Upload**: Automatically extracts audio from video files (`.mp4`, `.mov`).
-   **AI-Powered Prediction**: Uses machine learning models to predict:
    -   **Gender**: Male or Female.
    -   **Age Group**: Teens, Twenties, Thirties, etc.
-   **Continuous Learning Pipeline**:
    -   **Feedback System**: Users can submit corrections if a prediction is inaccurate.
    -   **Data Collection**: All submitted audio and corrected labels are stored securely.
    -   **Model Retraining**: Includes a script to retrain the models on the growing dataset, continuously improving their accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

-   **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
-   **Machine Learning**: [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [Librosa](https://librosa.org/) (for audio feature extraction)
-   **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
-   **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud

### System Architecture

The project has two main workflows:

1.  **User Interaction Flow (app.py)**:
    `User Input (Record/Upload) -> Feature Extraction -> Prediction -> Display Results -> User Provides Feedback -> Store Audio & Metadata`

2.  **Model Retraining Pipeline (retrain_model.py)**:
    `Original Dataset + User Submissions -> Combine Data -> Re-extract All Features -> Train New Models -> Save Updated Models`

## ⚙️ Setup and Local Installation

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9 or higher
-   Git

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Download the Dataset

This project uses the Mozilla Common Voice dataset. The data is **not** included in the repository and must be downloaded manually.

1.  Visit the [Common Voice Datasets page](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets) and download a version of the English corpus.
2.  Create a `data/` folder in the project's root directory.
3.  Unzip the downloaded archive and move the following items into your `data/` folder:
    -   The CSV file (e.g., `cv-valid-train.csv`)
    -   The audio clips folder (e.g., `cv-valid-train`)

Your directory structure should look like this:
```
.
├── data/
│   ├── cv-valid-train.csv
│   └── cv-valid-train/
│       ├── sample-000000.mp3
│       └── ...
├── app.py
└── ...
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Initial Model Training

Before running the app for the first time, you must train the initial models.

```bash
python train_model.py
```
This script will process the data in the `data/` folder and create the initial model files in a new `saved_models/` directory.

### 2. Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

### 3. Retrain the Model with New Data

As users provide feedback through the app, new audio and labels will be saved in the `user_submissions/` folder. To improve the models with this new data, run the retraining script:

```bash
python retrain_model.py
```
This will combine the original dataset with the new feedback, train new models, and overwrite the old ones in `saved_models/`. The Streamlit app will automatically use the improved models on its next run.

## ☁️ Deployment Notes

This application is designed for deployment on Streamlit Cloud.

-   The model files (`.pkl`) are too large for the GitHub repository.
-   The deployed app downloads the model files on its first startup from a separate cloud storage location (e.g., Google Drive) and caches them for performance. This logic is handled in `model.py`.
